Alternative Name/s: crown cap, Crown Cork Cap
Details:
The bottle cap was developed in 1891 by the inventor William [invented by] Painter*. By 1892, patents for the product were secured in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Painter’s invention, also known as the crown cap, addressed persistent problems with the bottling of carbonated beverages.  These drinks had enjoyed increased popularity (due to reputed medicinal benefits) since their development by Jacob Schweppe and Joseph Priestley in the late 1700’s.  However, the stoppers used at the time led to chronic leakage and, often, contamination of the bottled drink.
Painter’s crimped metal cap proved secure, simple and quick to affix,  and included cork liners (since then replaced with plastic or PVC), which rendered bottles leak-proof.  While numerous bottle cap types have since been developed, Painter’s crown cap design remains the most widely used.  The disposable nature of the crown cap addressed Painter’s objective to market an invention with renewable demand, and led his Crown Cork and Seal Company to great financial success.  He also invented machinery that efficiently filled bottles with soft drink mixture and affixed bottle caps in short sequence.
