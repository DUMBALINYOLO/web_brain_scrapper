Life & Times:
Catherine the Great was born Sophie Fredericke.  She was a robust and intelligent child, often punished by her parents for her zeal and curiosity.  When Empress Elizabeth of Russia agreed to meet Sophie as a possible match for her nephew, the 14 year-old Sophie and her mother concealed their identities and made the trip.  Karl Ulrich (later Grand Duke Peter of Holstein), Elizabeth’s nephew and heir to the throne, married his cousin Sophie in 1745.  When they married, Sophie changed her name and abjured the Lutheran religion, becoming Catherine of Russia, member of the Orthodox Church.  Her religious conversion was a significant one: the Orthodox Church permitted a man to divorce his wife and send her to a convent if she displeased him, which was what Peter intended to do once he had an heir.  Catherine had two children: Paul (1754) and Alexei (1762).
Peter ascended the throne January 5, 1762, but his erratic behavior and contempt of all things Russian alienated his subjects.  Catherine, conversely, had a loyal following.  On July 9, 1762 the Imperial Guards overthrew Peter and placed Catherine on the throne.  Eight days later word reached Catherine that Peter was dead, allegedly in a quarrel with one of the guards. 
As Empress, Catherine wanted to carry on the work of her idol [admired] Peter the Great*, which included attempts to reform Russia and establish it as a great nation.  However, when Catherine assumed control the state was nearly bankrupt.   Nevertheless, Catherine was determined to promote her political vision modeled on French Enlightenment thinking, specifically, that of [influenced by] Voltaire* and [influenced by] Diderot*.  Voltaire was known for his crusade against ignorance, inequality, and tyranny.  And Diderot’s Encyclopedie had been Catherine’s source of inspiration with its message of tolerance, moderation, and humanitarianism.  In an attempt to realize her vision, Catherine began several projects for reform including an enlightened code of laws based on the writings of [influenced by] Beccaria* and [influenced by] Montesquieu*. 
Critics argued that her motivation was to create a favorable image in Europe; however, evidence shows that she was probably sincere in her dedication.  She established the First Russian school for girls and a medical college to provide health care for her subjects.  She also carried out reforms in the Academy of Sciences, aimed at increasing Russian intellectual prestige.  The leading mathematician of the 18th century, Swiss born [hired] Leonard Euler*, returned to Russia in 1766 to head the Academy; though he was known for his brilliance in math and physics, Euler was also a firm believer in the freedom of will and was involved in many larger social debates. 
Catherine corresponded with the mathematician [corresponded with] d’Alembert* (who edited Diderot’s Encyclopedie and accused Euler of stealing his ideas); she eventually requested him as a tutor for her son - a job he declined.  In an era where monarchs turned to philosophers and enlightenment thinkers for social policy, [influenced by] Jeremy Bentham* sought government interest in his constitutional and political schemes.  Specifically, he hoped his “panopticon,” a prison model where prisoners were observed by unseen guards, would interest Catherine.  Since she saw the purpose of laws as a means for reform and reeducation, Bentham’s vision appealed to her. 
Despite her social concern, Catherine did little to abolish serfdom; instead, she supported the Russian gentry and showered her supporters with privileges such as state lands, offices, and more control over serfs.  Years of oppression by nobles culminated in 1773 with a great revolt.  The [exiled] Dukhobors*, a term used to define a group of pacifist Russian peasants, were moved to the farthest reaches of the Russian Empire.   The revolt rekindled old grievances, heroic legends of the Cossack revolt, and rumors that Peter III was still alive (men pretending to be Peter were not uncommon).  The two-year revolt that raged over much of the Volga River Basin and the Urals triggered a more reactionary internal policy by Catherine’s government. 
At the same time, Catherine was dealing with the ongoing war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire.  Russia’s frontier expanded southward as the Ottoman Empire declined.  The Russo-Turkish war (1768-74 and 1787-92) was the result of Turkey’s demand that Catherine stay out of Poland.  Aided by her future lover, [affair with] Potemkin*, Russian defeated Turkey and gained the Crimea and the North Coast of the Black Sea.  Potemkin’s skill as a field officer caught Catherine’s attention.  He quickly became the “court favorite” and there is evidence that the two were secretly married in 1774. 
In addition to her political and military reputation, Catherine was also one of the world’s great collectors of art, treasures, and lovers.  She was particularly interested in decorative arts and had an impressive collection of jewelry, porcelain, ivories, snuffboxes, medals, and even a wig made of silver threads.   For example, [bought from] Wedgewood* designed a setting (“Green Frog”) in 1773 and she acquired [bought painting by] Mengs*’ last major painting, “Perseus and Andromeda.”  Her interest was not limited to the finer things, she also bought (and donated) a telescope from [bought telescope from] William Herschel*, though she failed to procure his specula mirrors.   Catherine sought the assistance of the French architect, archaeologist, and artist [commissioned work by] Clerisseau* for inspiration in the design of her palace.  The rumors of her sexual appetite appear to be exaggerated, though Catherine loved to surround herself with young and attractive men.  When Catherine died on November 17, 1796 she was assured her place as one of the most famous and notorious monarchs in history.
Extra Connections:  She sent money to [supported] L’Epee*
She was an admirer of  [an admirer of] CJ Fox*
She employed [employed]John Paul Jones*
 
Assessment: She fought for the rights of her subjects and the place of Russia as a major world power.
