"Circular Letter" to the thirteen colonies, (1767)
 
Life & Times:
In 1743, after completing his thesis on the subject "Whether it be Lawful to Resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot be otherwise Preserved", Adams graduated with a master’s degree.
 
A decade later, he was elected to a minor government post and, in 1756 became a relatively unsuccessful tax collector. By the time he was forty, Adams was a devout but unambitious man who wrote articles about ideal states of government and seemed to be uninterested in affairs outside his home town. 
 
In 1764, Adams was outraged when the English parliament passed the Sugar Act.  This lowered the import tax on molasses in order to make smuggling less profitable, and imposed taxes for the colonists on other imports such as silk, coffee, wine, salt and ironware.
 
The powerful members of the Caucus Club in Boston asked him to write a series of instructions to the Boston representatives in the Massachusetts Assembly.
The aim was to remove the conservative Chief Justice, Thomas Hutchinson, who was loyal to the British, and to challenge the idea that the authority of the British government extended to taxing colonists.
 
There was no law saying that the colonists couldn’t be taxed by London but, by custom, the colonists taxed themselves to raise the revenue for paying their own officials.  Knowing that many in the Assembly wouldn’t be bothered by the Sugar Act, Adams pointed out that to be taxed without legal representation meant that their land, produce and possessions were equally vulnerable. 
 
The Stamp Act of 1665, which imposed a tax on every legal and business transaction in the colonies, proved his point and Adam’s principle, of “no taxation without representation”, became the rallying cry for the supporters of independence.
 
In September, he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he became the chief voice of the radical opposition.  Adams formed an alliance with the publishers of the Boston "Gazette" and wrote anonymous articles and editorials, which emphasised the point that the colonists were being taxed by a body in which they were not represented.
 
Under pressure from the colonists, the British Parliament was forced to repeal the Stamp Act in 1766 but then passed the so-called Tea Act the following year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, [attacked policy of] Charles Townshend*, imposed duties on imports to the American colonies, including paint, paper, glass and tea, so Adams wrote a "Circular Letter" to the other colonial Assemblies, recommending that they stand united in opposition. 
 
In 1768, the British sent troops to Boston to maintain peace, but violence was inevitable and in 1770, British soldiers killed four Bostonians. Adams led a delegation to the King’s representative, Governor Hutchinson, forcing him to order the troops out of town.
 
The taxes on the majority of products (with the exception of tea) were repealed, and, with the British army gone, things settled down.  Adams wasn’t happy with this state of affairs, so he continued to keep the issue alive through published articles.
 
In 1772, the British declared that officials and judges would be paid from customs revenues, to be held by the British.  At Adams' suggestion, the colonies set up Committees of Correspondence, whose aim was to work for inter-colonial unity and to write to influential contacts around the world, highlighting the injustice of British actions against the colonists.
 
The British upset the colonies even more when, in 1773, they allowed the [attacked the policy of]  East India Company* to import goods to Britain independently, ignoring the established channels in Boston. In London, [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with] Benjamin Franklin*, (who had warned the British about the dangers of the Stamp Act, now told them that the Americans would not stand for this, but the British refused to listen.
 
In December 1773, three British ships arrived in Boston harbour with their cargo of tea.  Adams demanded that Hutchinson order them to turn away but, when he refused, a group of men stormed the ships during the night and dumped the tea into the harbour.  This event is remembered as the Boston Tea Party.
 
The British made a decisive mistake when they reacted drastically by closing down the port of Boston and moving the provincial capital to Salem.  [knew]Paul Revere* took the news to New York and Pennsylvania, returning with an offer to set up a Congress of Delegates from all thirteen colonies.  In Virginia, [work related to] Jefferson* and others made the same suggestion. 
 
When the Massachusetts Assembly met in Salem in June 1774, Adams locked the chamber door to prevent the conservative governor dissolving the assembly before representatives, including Adams, were elected to the First Continental Congress of all thirteen colonies.
 
At the Congress, Adams’ most significant contribution was the formation of the Continental Association, which agreed a blockade on British imports.  Although in danger of arrest by British troops, he escaped to Philadelphia to attend the second Congress in 1775, where he became friendly with [a pal of] Thomas Paine*, the editor of the Pennsylvania "Gazette". 
 
That same year, the first action in the war of independence was fought in Lexington. Adams threw his support behind [a supporter of] Washington*, upholding his right to conduct the war as he saw fit,  and he voted for and signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. 
 
Adams sat in Congress until 1781, two years before the recognition of American independence, then returned to Boston, where he was a member of the State Senate but, as he grew older, his influence declined.
 
His second cousin (and co-signer of the Declaration of Independence) [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Adams*, became the second President after served in England as minister for the United States.  John sent letters, via his son, [family member was] John Quincy Adams*, to keep Adams, now in his old age, well informed.
 
Extra Connections: He was a colleague in Congress of Silas [colleague of] Deane*
He signed the Declaration of Independence with [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Hancock*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Josiah Bartlett*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Whipple*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Robert Treat Paine*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Stephen Hopkins*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Ellery*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Roger Sherman*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Samuel Huntington*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Williams*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Floyd*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Philip Livingston*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Francis Lewis*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Lewis Morris*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Richard Stockton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Witherspoon*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Francis Hopkinson*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Hart*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Abraham Clark*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Robert Morris*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Benjamin Rush*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Morton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Clymer*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]James Smith*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Taylor*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]James Wilson*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Ross*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Caesar Rodney*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Read*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Samuel Chase*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Paca*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas Stone*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Charles Carroll*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas Jefferson*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Benjamin Harrison*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas Nelson*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Francis Lightfoot Lee*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Carter Braxton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]William Hooper*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Joseph Hewes*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]John Penn*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Edward Rutledge*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas Heyward*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas Lynch Jr.*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Arthur Middleton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Button Gwinett*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Lyman Hall*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Walton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]George Wythe*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Elbridge Gerry*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Richard Henry Lee*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Oliver Wolcott*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Matthew Thornton*,  [was a Declaration of Independence co-signer with]Thomas McKean*
 
Assessment: Adams was the leading publicist of the American Revolution and was largely responsible for firing the colonists’ desire for independence after 1764.
