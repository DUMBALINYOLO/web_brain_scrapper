DNA
 
Alternative Name/s: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
 
Details:
Thanks to work by [discovered by] Crick and Watson* ( [inspired by] Schrodinger*) it is known that DNA is the primary building block of life on Earth.  It is comprised of a repeating pattern of four different amino acids (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, represented by the letters A, T, G and C) strung together in a double-helix shape (looking like a spiral staircase).  
 
The genetic code for every organism, from humans to viruses, is locked in the combination and location of these amino acids on the DNA macromolecule.   These sequences provide the programming code for each organism, determining how the organism looks, how it metabolizes food or fights off infection, how it behaves.  Each organism has a unique DNA “fingerprint” which differentiates it from other members of its own species, as well as from other species.
 
DNA can be used in criminal forensics to identify whether someone is guilty, or innocent.  It can be used in medical research to predict the occurrence of certain inherited diseases, like Down’s Syndrome, in children. 
 
DNA manipulation has produced various strains of disease- and pest-resistant crops that may changed agriculture around the planet.   Through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer (a form of cloning), scientists have been able to produce offspring of sheep, mice, goats, pigs, cats, rabbits, and a wild ox called a gaur. 
 
Questions concerning the ethics and morals related to cloning, genetic manipulation of plants and animals, the collection and storing of human DNA information, the use of this information for medical screening purposes, and how this information might impact families, insurance companies, and society as a whole are being asked, and answers are being debated.
