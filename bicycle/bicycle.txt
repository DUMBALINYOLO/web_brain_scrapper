Full Name: Bicycle
Nickname/Alias: velocipede
 
Details:
The first true bicycle, with pedals on the (larger) front wheel and a wooden frame and wheels, was put on the market in 1864 by the company set up by French blacksmith Pierre [developed by]Michaux.*   It had iron ties and was known as the “boneshaker.” 
 
The bicycle craze soon disappeared in France, but interest grew in England and the US.  A few years later (in the UK) the modern metal frame first appeared.  It consisted of the main triangle (which carries the seat, handlebars and fork) attached to the rear triangle (carrying the rear wheel).
 
In 1888 Northern Irish veterinarian John Boyd Dunlop invented the first pneumatic rubber bicycle tires.
 
Gears were developed between 1901 and 1906 (UK inventors: Sturmey & Archer)
Over the years,  the metal from which bicycles are made has changed from iron to steel, to aluminum alloy, titanium, and lately, carbon fiber.  Modern mountain bikes often have suspension built into their frames.
 
The bicycle is at present enjoying a renaissance, as concerns grow regarding pollution and the greenhouse-gas effects of automobile use.   In the light of these concerns, in 2006 the French city of Paris introduced free bikes, to be picked up anywhere and dropped off anywhere  by any user.
