Name: Kaleidoscope

Details: The kaleidoscope, invented by David [invented by] Brewster* about 1816, consists of a tube (usually with triangular sides) containing loose fragments of colored material (originally, glass) and lined with mirrors.  As the instrument is rotated the movement of the glass fragments produces an ever-changing series of geometric images. 
The kaleidoscope works through the image-forming by combined, inclined mirrors placed at angles to each other.  Any object between two mirrors placed at right angles to each other makes an image in each and each image also appears in the other, creating the impression of four symmetrical objects.  If the mirrors are placed at 60 degrees to each other (in the triangle-sided tube) the result is six regular images.
In the 1870’s an American named Charles Bush improved on the original design and started a kaleidoscope fad. 
Today the kaleidoscope has become a collector’s item.
