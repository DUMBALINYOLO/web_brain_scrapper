Chewing Gum
 
Details:
Chewing gum is used today by hundreds of millions of people all over the world.  It first became popular after being brought to the United States by Mexican General [introduced by] Santa Anna*.   In 1869 he introduced a young photographer, Thomas Adams to chicle (made from the sap of the sapodilla tree) and Adams patented a chicle-manufacturing technique two years later. 
In 1888 Adams ‘Tutti Frutti’ became the first gum sold in vending machines.  With the introduction in 1893 of the Wrigley ‘Spearmint’ brand came the popular mint flavor that would boost chewing gum sales in the Wrigley company alone to over $1m a year.  The Wrigley company went on to become one of the biggest advertisers in the U.S.  In 1928 came the first successful pink-colored ‘Double Bubble’ bubble-gum, invented by Water Diemer, who worked for the Fleer Chewing Gum Co.  The first double bubble blowing contest was televised in 1954.  Popularized by GIs in WWII.
